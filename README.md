# Hi, I'm Matias ðŸ‘‹
## Backend developer

I develop with C++ on my daily basis. Also I like to work with Python and Bash.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Gaming industry as backend developer at [Globant](https://www.globant.com/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity because I'm really interested in Web3 technologies which offers the opportunity of making decentralized apps/platforms and depend anymore on the common big tech and/or financial corporations. I'd like to jump on this area sometime in the near future and make cool apps for the benefit of people.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects with a positive impact such as social or green projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/mguarna/mguarna/issues)
